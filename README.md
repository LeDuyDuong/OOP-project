## 2. Introduction
### a. Motivation
The name of our game is IU Detective which somewhat demonstrates the main purpose of playing this game. Recently, there have been many cases in which IU students’ properties get stolen by some thieves at the campus.  This reason is a partial motivation for us to create this small detective and problem-solving games.
### b. Brief description
- In this game, the player will control the main character – a student detective to find out who is truly the thief of a stolen backpack case with some hints, evidences as well as guides to solve some riddles provided by the game. Moreover, the player has to collect useful tools on the way or to interact with other characters like students and lecturers or objects like opening/close the door, turning on/off something and extract information by reading some letters or description about something.
- The game is a 2D pixel game and its environment will mimic the actual infrastructure of IU. Therefore, this game will allow us to visit the campus virtually while we enjoy playing it. Especially, due to the Covid-19, many subjects have to be conducted online for the students and they may not have a chance to go to the campus frequently. This game will be a fine solution for this situation.
